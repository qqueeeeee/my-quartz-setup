I was randomly scrolling YouTube when I came across this video [Interview with Obsidian enthusiast 2026](https://youtu.be/NSTT2iBSwZs?si=PmiKESEHER2a3axc), I found someone's digital garden. A website built entirely from their Obsidian notes. I remember just staring at the graph view — hundreds of nodes, all with a meaning, purpose. It was so beautiful. 

Every single connection in that graph existed because two ideas were actually related. They emerged naturally from the notes themselves, from someone just writing down what they knew and linking it to what they already knew. The graph was a byproduct of genuine thinking.

Now, I try to reach that, my own "second brain", that's what you're looking at.
