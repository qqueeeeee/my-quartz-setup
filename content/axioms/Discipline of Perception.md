In a crowded café, two people sit across from each other. To most observers, it’s just a casual meeting. But someone trained in perception notices the subtle lean of one person’s torso, the tension in the jaw, the way the hand grips the coffee cup just a little too tightly. From these small cues, a deeper story emerges: there’s conflict under the surface.

This isn’t intuition. It’s perception — an ability to gather and interpret information that others overlook. While it can look like something insane, it’s really the refinement of ordinary senses through discipline. And like any discipline, it can be learned.

We often assume that observers are born with special gifts. We say, "some people just pick up on things”. But research on expertise shows otherwise. Just as musicians train their ears and athletes train their reflexes, you can train your attention.

In fact, the average person notices far less than they think. Psychologists call this “change blindness.” This is literally the concept talked about in [[Vagabond]] — [[Preoccupied with a single leaf]]. In experiments, people fail to spot even large changes in a scene when their focus is directed elsewhere. This means that what looks like intuition is often just the result of structured practice.
