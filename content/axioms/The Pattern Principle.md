### How you do one thing, dictates how you do everything.

I noticed this about myself and I can't ignore it anymore. There's a pattern that shows up in everything I do, and once you see it you can't unsee it.

When I pick up something new — a game, a skill, a tool, I don't ease into it. I obsess. I grind it for hundreds of hours, configure every little detail, push until I'm at the very least, satisfied. With [[Arch Linux|my Linux setup]] I spent days just ricing, tweaking every corner of the setup. With[[Video Games| games]] I don't stop until I'm good. The obsession is total while it lasts and then eventually, it ends; I switch back to Windows or I move onto a different game, the result is the same.

This is just how I am. The pattern is always the same: obsession → progress → boredom → the next thing. I am currently working on my [[Boredom Tolerance]] to get out of this loop so that I stick to what I started and truly finish it.
