I grew up with games, these are what I spent most of my time on. Though, I've been being way more productive in the past ~1 year, my love for them never died and I doubt it will ever die.   

These are the games I truly love and will always love:
 1) [[Superfighters Deluxe]]
 2) [[Ironsight]]
 3) [[Fishao]]
 4) [[Brawlhalla]]
 
For 4+ years when I was in school, I played [[Superfighters Deluxe]] for at least 4 hours every single day. Then they released a paid Steam version and my 16 year old self couldn't afford it, so I moved to [[Brawlhalla]]. I currently have over 2,600 hours on it and got top 7 in a tournament.

It was hours of grind, fun and a lot more. I watched guides, grinded ranked constantly, analyzed what I was doing wrong. The same competitive drive that pushes me to be good at everything I touch, games were where I first noticed it in myself.

Gaming taught me something important: getting good at anything requires obsession, not talent. I wasn't good at the start itself, I just cared more and put in more hours than most people were willing to and got there after a lot of work.
