Hello, I'm Sasank also known as Que, This is my [[Digital Garden]], It will consist notes on a fair amount of the stuff I come across, projects I do, or information I consume. The point of it is to be "interactive" unlike other [[Quartz]] projects from other people. I want this to be unique and fully interactable. 

### How to use 

You can see the "index" of my notes here — [[Table of Contents]] it will show you what all is there in here, my preferred way to use it is through the Graph you see behind, it's quite hard to miss as it's the main attraction of this page. You can use the following key-binds to interact and use it;

**Ctrl + F — Search
Tab — Show labels 
Esc — Close any opened Modals**

That's it! Those are the main key-binds you need to know to explore. 

### What the folders are

The folders are the way I organize everything so that it's easier for me to find everything.

**axioms — These are my thoughts, any "knowledge" I gained through reading books etc. 
fleeting — These are my temporary notes, where I put anything that I don't want to forget.
journaling — This is where my daily journal go, but since it's a private folder most links to it will be broken.
learning — This is where most of the content for this page is in, this is where I write down everything I learn in case I need to re-visit it.**
