Hello, I'm Sasank also known as Que, This is my [[Digital Garden]], It will consist notes on a fair amount of the stuff I come across, projects I do, or information I consume. I consider myself a competitive typer at 175wpm in combination with keyboard-centric computer interaction ([[Neovim]] & [[glazewm]]).
